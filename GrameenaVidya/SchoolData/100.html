            <h3>Appeal Letter to Donors</h3>
<h4>Dear Sir/Madam,</h4>
<i><b>Sub:</b> : Request to sponsor digital education in our school through Adopt-a-School Program</i><br />

<p class="letter-body">Since the early 2000s the school has tried to keep pace with changing needs of the society &#45;of skills in the use of computers both for teaching and learning.  We appeal to donors and Grameena Vidya to take us under their wings in the Adopt-a-school program, provide us with the required IT infrastructure. We believe digital classrooms will enhance teaching and learning and will empower the girl students from the bottom of the pyramid and will create a level playing field on par with the students attending urban private English medium schools. These digital classrooms can become multi-functional entities, to help prepare students on regular curriculum specific content, provide virtual labs for science, math and English, provide IT skills and more. WE ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR PHILANTHROPHY WILL HAVE AN IMMENSE IMPACT ON OUR STUDENTS ACADEMIC AND PREPARATION FOR LIFE IN SPECIFIC AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IN GENERAL.</p>
<h5>Yours truly,</h5>

<h5><b>Prabhakar </b><br />
Principal</h5>
