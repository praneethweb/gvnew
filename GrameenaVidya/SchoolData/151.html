            <h3>Appeal Letter to Donors</h3>
<h4>Dear Sir/Madam,</h4>
<i><b>Sub:</b> Sub: Adopt-a-School Program &#45; Appeal for funding IT Infrastructure and Digital Learning</i><br />

<p class="letter-body">Despite the socio-economic disadvantage, our students have shown year on year improvements. We have achieved 94% pass during the academic year 2014-15. Our Alumni over the years have spread across Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India and the world and have turned into responsible employees, family men and citizens. Our school is the heart beat of the neighborhood. It is the only affordable accessible school for families at the grassroots. Every student coming to us have big dreams and are excited to contribute their little bit for the betterment of all. Our teachers are dedicated to improving and motivating students to achieve more. Despite high odds of 1:48 teacher: student ratio and qualified teachers being underpaid due to budgetary constraints, day-in and day-out our teachers nurture our students with the right values and academics. </p>
<p>We strongly believe introducing technology into teaching and learning will propel our school to compete with the private schools and help our students score better and equip them with skills. We believe Grameena Vidya&#39;s and Donor&#39;s support and investment in our school will certainly create a conducive environment that will make everyone proud. I will be glad to provide additional information as needed.</p>

<h5>Yours truly,</h5>

<h5><b></b><br />
Principal</h5>
